# splines
Following a tutorial to create 2D splines in Unity. Splines are very useful for roads, AI movement, and lots of other things, but they are not the simplest thing to make. We're going to be doing some good old vector math. I will need to expand upon the 2D splines used in the tutorial and make them 3D before importing them into the PoorlyAnimatedRacing game to build tracks.
